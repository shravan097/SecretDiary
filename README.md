# SecretDiary
I always wanted a blog but more like a secret diary. So I created a Django and Python Powered Website that will let you save a diary that is only accessible by you only.

## How to Run this Code:
**You must have Python 3 to run this code. Look [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
To check if you installed Python 3, run this on terminal `python3 --version`.

Next, you need to install, Django.
Run this on terminal `sudo pip3 install Django`
And just run this to check if you installed Django properlly. `python3 -m django --version`

Now, go to the directory where you have this SecretDiary cloned. Then again go inside blog_project.
Then run this:
`python3 manage.py runserver`

Now go to your browser and type this on the URL: (http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/).

Your Secret Diary should be running.
